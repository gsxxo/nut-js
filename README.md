</p>

`nut.js` is a cross-platform native UI automation / testing tool.

It allows for native UI interactions via keyboard and / or mouse,
but additionally gives you the possibility to navigate the screen based on image matching.

# Examples

[nut-tree/trailmix](https://github.com/nut-tree/trailmix) contains a set of ready to use examples which demo the usage ot nut.js.

# Discussion

In [nut-tree/rfc](https://github.com/nut-tree/rfc) documents regarding larger design / implementation changes in nut.js are up for discussion.

# Sample

The following snippet shows a valid `nut.js` example (on macOS)

```js
"use strict";

const { keyboard, Key, mouse, left, right, up, down, screen } = require("@nut-tree/nut-js");

const square = async () => {
  await mouse.move(right(500));
  await mouse.move(down(500));
  await mouse.move(left(500));
  await mouse.move(up(500));
};

const openSpotlight = async () => {
  await keyboard.pressKey(Key.LeftSuper);
  await keyboard.pressKey(Key.Space);
  await keyboard.releaseKey(Key.Space);
  await keyboard.releaseKey(Key.LeftSuper);
};

(async () => {
    await square();
    await openSpotlight();
    await keyboard.type("calculator");
    await keyboard.type(Key.Return);
})();
```

# Installation

`nut.js` comes with a pre-built version of OpenCV for your respective target platform.
In order to use these pre-compiled bindings, certain runtime conditions have to be met.

## Prerequisites

This section lists runtime requirements for `nut.js` on the respective target platform.
`nut.js` is built and tested against node 10 and later as well as Electron 4 and later, so in order to use `nut.js` please make sure to use one of these versions.

#### Windows

In order to install `nut.js` on Windows, please make sure to have the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) installed.

#### macOS

On macOS, Xcode command line tools are required.
You can install them by running
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Attention**:

In case you're experiencing problems like your mouse not moving or your keyboard not typing,
please make sure to give the process you're executing your tests with accessibility permissions.

If an application wants to use accessibility features, a permission pop-up should be shown.
If not, you could try to manually add the application you're running the script from.

`Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility -> Add...`

#### Linux

Depending on your distribution, Linux setups may differ.

In general, `nut.js` requires

- libXtst

Installation on `*buntu` distributions:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev
```

Setups on other distributions might differ.

## Install `nut.js`

Running 

```bash
npm i @nut-tree/nut-js
```

or

```bash
yarn add @nut-tree/nut-js
```

will install `nut.js` and its required dependencies.

### Snapshot releases

`nut.js` also provides snapshot releases which allows to test upcoming features.

Running 

```bash
npm i @nut-tree/nut-js@next
```

or

```bash
yarn add @nut-tree/nut-js@next
```

will install the most recent development release of `nut.js`.

**Attention**: While snapshot releases are great to work with upcoming features before a new stable release, it is still a snapshot release.
Please bear in mind that things might change and / or break on snapshot releases, so it is not recommended using them in production.

### Usage with Electron

`nut.js` in combination with Electron requires bindings built for use with Electron.
`nut.js` does provide such bindings and e.g. [electron-rebuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-rebuild) makes installation a breeze.

Besides installing `nut.js` via

```bash
npm i @nut-tree/nut-js
```

or

```bash
yarn add @nut-tree/nut-js
```

we also install `electron-rebuild` as a `devDependency`:

```bash
npm i -D electron-rebuild
```

or 

```bash
yarn add -D electron-rebuild
```

Next, we add a `rebuild` script to our `package.json`:

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "start": "electron app.js",
        "rebuild": "electron-rebuild"
    },
    ...,
}
```

Now all we have to do is run `npm run rebuild` and `electron-rebuild` will fetch the appropriate bindings for our Electron version.
Currently `nut.js` provides bindings for all ABI version to work with Electron v4.x up to 8.x

### Manual build

As a fallback, `nut.js` is able to build all required dependencies by itself.
To do so, some setup is required on the respective target platform.

#### Windows

In order to install `nut.js` on Windows, [Windows Build Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159) and [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) are required.
You can either set them up manually, or install them via npm:

```bash
npm install --global windows-build-tools
```

or

```bash
yarn global add windows-build-tools
```

#### macOS

On macOS, Xcode command line tools are required.
You can install them by running
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Linux

Depending on your distribution, Linux setups may differ.

In general, `nut.js` requires

- Python 2
- g++
- make
- libXtst
- libPng

Installation on `*buntu` distributions:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential python libxtst-dev libpng++-dev
```

Setups on other distributions might differ.
